## 💻 About the project

<p>It's a simple REST API containing data for each podcast episode. That's why we used json-server, designed for front-end developers who need a quick backend solution for prototyping and simulation.</p>

[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Additionally, it's good to have an editor for working with the code, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After cloning this project, install the dependencies:

```
yarn install

And run using:

yarn server
```
